# Ember Starter

A boilerplate I use for rapidly front-end web development, made up with my favourite tool-stack:

- Pure HTML
- Sass
- Compass (susy, breakpoint)
- Ember.js
- Pure Javascript/CoffeeScript
- Mocha (Chai)
- Karma
- Grunt

Follow these steps to make it work:

1. First, you need Ruby/Sass/Compass/Susy installed, also need Node/Npm installed.

2. Clone this repository (or just download the source)

3. Run `npm install`

4. Run `bower install`

Done, and enjoy!
